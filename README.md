## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the Expense Tracker up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (LTS version recommended) & npm (or yarn)
* Python 3.8+ & pip
* MongoDB (Local installation or a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-github-username/expense-tracker-webApp.git](https://github.com/your-github-username/expense-tracker-webApp.git)
cd expense-tracker-webApp
(Replace your-github-username with your actual GitHub username)

2. Backend Setup
Navigate into the backend directory:

Bash

cd backend
a. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

Bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
b. Install Dependencies

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
(If requirements.txt doesn't exist, create it by running pip freeze > requirements.txt after installing dependencies manually with pip install Flask pymongo python-dotenv Flask-Cors Werkzeug)

c. Configure Environment Variables
Create a file named .env in the backend directory with the following content:

Code snippet

MONGO_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/expense_tracker"
FRONTEND_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000"
# Add other sensitive variables here if needed, e.g., email service API keys
MONGO_URI: Replace with your MongoDB connection string. If you're using a local MongoDB instance, mongodb://localhost:27017/expense_tracker should work. For MongoDB Atlas, use your provided connection string.

FRONTEND_BASE_URL: This is crucial for constructing the password reset link. Ensure it matches the URL where your React frontend will be running.

d. Run the Flask Backend

Bash

flask run --port 5001 # Or python app.py if you prefer
The backend will run on http://localhost:5001.

3. Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal and navigate back to the project root, then into the frontend directory:

Bash

cd .. # Go back to the project root: expense-tracker-webApp
cd frontend
a. Install Dependencies

Bash

npm install # Or yarn install
b. Run the React Frontend

Bash

npm start
The frontend will run on http://localhost:3000 (or another available port).
